## Quality Assurance Framework

### Universal Quality Standards

**CREATE Framework Compliance:**

- [ ] Character definition appropriate for use case scale
- [ ] Request specification clear and actionable at target scale
- [ ] Examples demonstrate quality outputs for intended audience
- [ ] Adjustments include appropriate constraints and requirements
- [ ] Type specification ensures compatibility with target workflows
- [ ] Extras provide comprehensive context for scale of implementation

**Quality Pyramid Integration:**

- [ ] Completeness: All necessary context for scale of implementation
- [ ] Accuracy: Validation appropriate for individual, team, or organizational standards
- [ ] Relevance: Optimization for specific use case and scale requirements
- [ ] Efficiency: Cost and performance optimization appropriate for implementation scale

### Scale-Specific Validation
