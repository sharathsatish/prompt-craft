# üìã Comprehensive PRD Writing Prompt

This prompt provides a systematic methodology for product managers and teams to draft comprehensive Product Requirements
Documents (PRDs) for any product or feature. It follows established patterns from successful PRDs and ensures consistency,
completeness, and implementability across projects and organizations.

**Tip:** A sample PRD template is available in the `snippets/prd-template.md` file. Use this as a starting point or
reference for your own PRDs.

## üìù PRD Template

**Before starting**, familiarize yourself with your team's PRD template, use the provided example in
`snippets/prd-template.md`, or use a standard structure that includes:

- **Complete PRD Structure**: Pre-defined sections for all key aspects of a product or feature
- **Guidance for AI or Technical Features**: Sections for model integration, prompt engineering, or technical context if relevant
- **Implementation-Ready Format**: Structure that supports a step-by-step implementation process
- **Quality Standards**: Built-in validation checklist and quality gates

**Usage Instructions:**

1. **Copy the template** from your team's documentation or use the example in `snippets/prd-template.md`
2. **Follow this prompt** to systematically fill out each section
3. **Use the template's validation checklist** to ensure completeness
4. **Reference successful PRDs** to understand patterns and quality standards

The template provides the structure; this prompt provides the methodology for filling it out effectively.

## üéØ PRD Creation Process

### Step 1: Research and Foundation

**Prompt Template:**

```markdown
I need to draft a new PRD for [FEATURE_NAME] in our product.

Before I start writing, please help me research and understand:

1. **Existing PRDs Analysis**:
   - Read all existing PRDs in the relevant directory or repository
   - Identify common patterns, structure, and language used
   - Note successful PRD examples for reference

2. **Project Context**:
   - Review the product roadmap and implementation sequence
   - Check current status for the feature or related areas
   - Understand how this feature fits into the overall architecture

3. **Dependencies and Relationships**:
   - Identify which existing PRDs or features this might depend on
   - Determine what future features this might enable
   - Check for potential conflicts or overlaps

4. **Current Codebase State**:
   - Review the codebase structure to understand current capabilities
   - Check existing types and interfaces if applicable
   - Identify integration points for the new feature

Please provide a summary of findings and recommendations for structuring this PRD.
```

**Expected Output**: Research summary with PRD structure recommendations and dependency mapping

### Step 2: Define Feature Scope and Value

**Prompt Template:**

```markdown
Based on the research, let's define the scope and value proposition for [FEATURE_NAME].

Please help me draft:

1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 paragraphs):
   - Clear definition of what this feature does
   - Primary value proposition and target users
   - Relationship to existing features or PRDs (builds on, enables, depends on)

2. **Independent Value Proposition**:
   - Immediate value this feature provides standalone
   - Benefits users get even without other features
   - Why this feature matters independently

3. **Problem Statement** (Current Challenges section):
   - 3-5 specific problems this feature solves
   - Business or user impact of these problems
   - Real-world scenarios where users encounter these issues

4. **Solution Overview**:

This guide, combined with a standard PRD template, ensures your PRD will be comprehensive, implementable, and
aligned with best practices for product development.

## Best Practices: ALWAYS / NEVER

**ALWAYS:**

- Use the standard PRD template as your base.
- Make every requirement testable and measurable.
- Clearly define MVP scope and exclude enhancements.
- Cross-reference related PRDs and documentation.
- Validate technical feasibility with the current architecture.

**NEVER:**

- Leave sections incomplete or with placeholders.
- Include vague, untestable, or non-measurable requirements.
- Overload the PRD with future enhancements.
- Ignore dependencies or integration points.
