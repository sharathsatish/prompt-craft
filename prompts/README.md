# Prompts: Ready-to-Use Patterns for Practical Applications

*Production-ready prompts organized by use case and role, demonstrating CREATE Framework and Quality Pyramid methodology*

## Overview

The Prompts directory contains immediately usable prompt patterns organized around practical applications and user
roles. Each prompt demonstrates systematic application of CREATE Framework and Quality Pyramid principles while
solving real-world challenges.

## Using the Prompts

### Quick Start Process

1. **Navigate** to the folder matching your use case or role
2. **Select** a prompt pattern that aligns with your specific need
3. **Customize** the template with your context and requirements
4. **Apply** CREATE Framework principles (Character, Request, Examples, Adjustments, Type, Extras)
5. **Validate** using Quality Pyramid assessment (Completeness, Accuracy, Relevance, Efficiency)
6. **Test** and iterate based on results

### Integration Patterns

Each prompt category integrates with repository resources:

- **[Guides](../guides/README.md)** - Implementation guidance for prompt customization
- **[Examples](../examples/README.md)** - Real-world applications and success stories
- **[Methodology](../methodology/README.md)** - Deep understanding of CREATE Framework principles
- **[Learning Resources](../learning-resources/README.md)** - Systematic skill development

### Quality Standards

All prompts include:

- ‚úÖ **Complete CREATE Framework structure** with all six elements
- ‚úÖ **Quality Pyramid validation** built into each pattern
- ‚úÖ **Practical application focus** solving real-world challenges
- ‚úÖ **Clear customization guidance** for different contexts
- ‚úÖ **Cross-role applicability** with role-specific adaptations

## Contributing

When contributing new prompts:

1. **Organize by use case or role** rather than methodology concepts
2. **Follow CREATE Framework structure** for all templates
3. **Include Quality Pyramid validation** mechanisms
4. **Provide clear customization guidance** for users
5. **Test with multiple scenarios** before submission
6. **Document practical applications** and expected outcomes
