## ‚úÖ **C-R-E-A-T-E Validation**

### **C - Character** ‚úì

- [ ] **Role defined**: Clear professional identity specified
- [ ] **Expertise level**: Experience and skill depth indicated  
- [ ] **Working style**: Communication approach and methodology stated
- [ ] **Quality standards**: Appropriate expectations set for the role

*Quick check: Could someone else read this and understand exactly what expert perspective the AI should take?*

### **R - Request** ‚úì

- [ ] **Specific action**: Clear verb + object + context structure
- [ ] **Measurable outcome**: Concrete deliverables defined
- [ ] **Success criteria**: How to evaluate quality and completeness
- [ ] **Priority clarity**: Most important outcomes highlighted

*Quick check: Is it crystal clear what should be delivered and how to know if it's successful?*

### **E - Examples** ‚úì

- [ ] **Quality demonstrations**: High-standard examples that teach patterns
- [ ] **Input-output clarity**: Both starting point and expected result shown
- [ ] **Teaching value**: Examples help understand principles, not just copy
- [ ] **Appropriate complexity**: Examples match the skill level and context

*Quick check: Do the examples enable someone to adapt the approach to similar situations?*

### **A - Adjustments** ‚úì

- [ ] **Quality controls**: Standards for accuracy and completeness
- [ ] **Behavioral boundaries**: Tone, approach, and appropriateness limits
- [ ] **Technical constraints**: Format, length, and structural requirements
- [ ] **Guardrails**: Clear "always do" and "never do" specifications

*Quick check: Are there sufficient constraints to prevent poor outcomes while enabling excellence?*

### **T - Type** ‚úì

- [ ] **Format specified**: Clear presentation and structure requirements
- [ ] **Length parameters**: Appropriate scope and depth defined
- [ ] **Organization pattern**: Information hierarchy and flow outlined
- [ ] **Integration needs**: Compatibility with tools/workflows considered

*Quick check: Will the output format integrate seamlessly with intended use and next steps?*

### **E - Extras** ‚úì

- [ ] **Context provided**: Relevant background and situational factors
- [ ] **Special requirements**: Unique constraints or success factors
- [ ] **Edge cases**: Potential complications or exceptions considered
- [ ] **Stakeholder awareness**: Broader goals and integration needs addressed

*Quick check: Does the AI have all the context needed for sophisticated, nuanced responses?*

## üöÄ **Quick Start Templates**

### **Individual Use** (Personal productivity)

```markdown
You are a [ROLE] helping me [SPECIFIC_GOAL].

Create [DELIVERABLE] that [SPECIFIC_OUTCOME].

Example: [SIMPLE_DEMONSTRATION]

Requirements:
- [KEY_CONSTRAINT_1]
- [KEY_CONSTRAINT_2]

Format: [STRUCTURE_PREFERENCE]

Context: [RELEVANT_BACKGROUND]
```

### **Team Use** (Collaborative work)

```markdown
You are a [ROLE] supporting our team's [PROJECT/GOAL].

Generate [DELIVERABLE] for [TEAM_CONTEXT] that achieves [MEASURABLE_OUTCOME].

Example format: [TEAM_STANDARD_DEMONSTRATION]

Standards:
- Quality: [TEAM_QUALITY_STANDARD]
- Consistency: [TEAM_STYLE_GUIDE]
- Collaboration: [SHARING_REQUIREMENTS]

Output: [TEAM_COMPATIBLE_FORMAT]

Team context: [PROJECT_BACKGROUND] and [STAKEHOLDER_CONSIDERATIONS]
```

### **Organizational Use** (Enterprise scaling)

```markdown
You are a [ROLE] creating [DELIVERABLE] for [ORGANIZATION_CONTEXT].

Develop [SPECIFIC_OUTPUT] that meets [ENTERPRISE_STANDARDS] and achieves [BUSINESS_OUTCOME].

Reference examples: [ENTERPRISE_TEMPLATE_EXAMPLES]

Compliance requirements:
- [REGULATORY_STANDARD]
- [BRAND_GUIDELINE]
- [QUALITY_FRAMEWORK]

Format: [ENTERPRISE_COMPATIBLE_STRUCTURE]

Organizational context: [BUSINESS_BACKGROUND], [STAKEHOLDER_ECOSYSTEM], and [STRATEGIC_ALIGNMENT]
```

## üîç **Quality Validation Questions**

### **Completeness Check**

- Is every CREATE element addressed?
- Would someone else understand exactly what's needed?
- Are all necessary constraints and context included?

### **Accuracy Check**

- Do examples demonstrate the right approach?
- Are quality standards appropriate for the use case?
- Is the expertise level correctly matched to the task?

### **Relevance Check**

- Does everything connect to the core goal?
- Is the complexity appropriate for the intended user?
- Will this work in the real-world context?

### **Efficiency Check**

- Is the prompt as concise as possible while remaining complete?
- Are there unnecessary elements that could be removed?
- Will this produce the desired outcome reliably?

## üìä **Scoring Guide**

**Excellent (20-24 checkmarks)**: Ready for immediate use  
**Good (16-19 checkmarks)**: Minor refinements needed  
**Needs Work (12-15 checkmarks)**: Significant improvements required  
**Start Over (< 12 checkmarks)**: Fundamental restructuring needed

---

## üí° **Pro Tips**

**üéØ Focus First**: Start with Request clarity - everything else supports a clear outcome

**üìù Template Reuse**: Save successful patterns for similar future needs

**üîÑ Iterate Fast**: Test with a simple version, then add complexity based on results

**üìè Right-Size**: Match complexity to importance - not every prompt needs maximum detail

**ü§ù Collaborate**: Share successful patterns with team members for consistency

*Remember: The CREATE Framework is a tool for excellence, not perfection. Start with the basics, then add sophistication as your needs grow.*
