## Module Overview

This educational module provides comprehensive training in the CREATE Framework - the foundational methodology
for systematic prompt engineering. Through structured lessons, practical exercises, and real-world applications,
you'll develop expertise in creating high-quality, consistent AI interactions.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

- **Master CREATE Framework Structure**: Apply all six elements systematically
- **Design Quality Prompts**: Create prompts that consistently deliver intended outcomes
- **Adapt Across Contexts**: Scale your skills from individual to team and organizational use
- **Validate and Iterate**: Systematically improve prompt quality and effectiveness

### Module Structure

**Time Investment:** 8-12 hours over 2-3 weeks
**Prerequisites:** Basic familiarity with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, or similar)
**Materials Needed:** Access to at least one AI platform for practice

## Lesson 1: CREATE Framework Foundation

### Learning Goals

- Understand each element of the CREATE Framework
- Recognize quality vs. ineffective prompts
- Apply basic CREATE structure to simple tasks

### Core Concepts

#### The CREATE Elements

**Character:** Define the AI's role and expertise

```markdown
You are a [ROLE] with [SPECIFIC EXPERTISE] who [KEY CHARACTERISTIC]
```

**Request:** Specify clear, actionable objectives

```markdown
[ACTION VERB] [SPECIFIC OBJECT] to [MEASURABLE OUTCOME]
```

**Examples:** Provide high-quality demonstrations

```markdown
### Example: [Clear Description]
Input: [What goes in]
Process: [Key steps]
Output: [Expected result]
```

**Adjustments:** Include constraints and quality standards

```markdown
**Requirements:**
- [Specific constraint 1]
- [Quality standard 1]
- [Boundary condition 1]
```

**Type:** Define output format and structure

```markdown
**Output Format:**
1. [Structure element 1]
2. [Structure element 2]
3. [Validation element]
```

**Extras:** Add context and special considerations

```markdown
**Additional Context:**
- [Relevant background]
- [Success criteria]
- [Special requirements]
```

### Practice Exercise 1.1: Basic CREATE Application

**Scenario:** Create a prompt for summarizing meeting notes

**Your Task:**

1. Apply each CREATE element to this scenario
2. Write a complete prompt following the framework
3. Test with a sample meeting transcript

**Sample Framework Application:**

```markdown
## Character
You are an executive assistant with expertise in meeting documentation and action item identification.

## Request
Summarize the provided meeting transcript into a concise executive summary with clear action items.

## Examples
[Provide example of transcript â†’ summary transformation]

## Adjustments
- Focus on decisions made and action items assigned
- Maintain professional tone
- Include all participants and their contributions

## Type
**Output Format:**
1. Meeting Summary (3-4 sentences)
2. Key Decisions (bulleted list)
3. Action Items (owner, task, deadline)
4. Next Steps

## Extras
Consider the meeting's purpose and audience when prioritizing information.
```

### Self-Assessment Checklist

- [ ] Character clearly defines role and expertise
- [ ] Request specifies measurable outcome
- [ ] Examples demonstrate the pattern
- [ ] Adjustments include quality standards
- [ ] Type defines clear output structure
- [ ] Extras provide necessary context

## Lesson 2: Character Definition Mastery

### Learning Goals

- Craft precise character definitions for different contexts
- Understand how character affects AI behavior and output quality
- Adapt character definitions for various audiences and purposes

### Character Design Principles

#### Specificity Drives Quality

**Weak Character:**

```markdown
You are helpful.
```

**Strong Character:**

```markdown
You are a senior technical writer with 8+ years of experience creating user
documentation for software products. You specialize in making complex
technical concepts accessible to non-technical users.
```

#### Context-Appropriate Expertise

**For Technical Audience:**

```markdown
You are a DevOps engineer with expertise in CI/CD pipelines, containerization,
and cloud infrastructure management.
```

**For Business Audience:**

```markdown
You are a business analyst who translates technical requirements into
clear business value propositions and implementation strategies.
```

### Practice Exercise 2.1: Character Adaptation

**Scenario:** Code review feedback

Create three different character definitions for the same code review task:

1. **For Junior Developer:** Mentoring and educational focus
2. **For Peer Developer:** Collaborative and constructive focus  
3. **For Senior Review:** Efficiency and strategic focus

### Practice Exercise 2.2: Multi-Context Characters

**Challenge:** Create character definitions for these scenarios:

1. **Customer Service Email Response**
   - Context: Upset customer with billing issue
   - Audience: General public
   - Goal: Resolution and relationship preservation

2. **Technical Documentation Review**
   - Context: API documentation for developers
   - Audience: Software engineers
   - Goal: Accuracy and completeness validation

3. **Content Strategy Analysis**
   - Context: Blog post performance review
   - Audience: Marketing team
   - Goal: Data-driven improvement recommendations

## Lesson 3: Request Specification Excellence

### Learning Goals

- Write clear, actionable requests that eliminate ambiguity
- Structure requests for consistent, high-quality outputs
- Balance specificity with appropriate flexibility

### Request Design Framework

#### The SMART-A Pattern

**Specific:** Exact action and object
**Measurable:** Quantifiable outcomes
**Actionable:** Clear steps possible
**Relevant:** Matches the character's expertise
**Time-bound:** Completion criteria
**Adaptable:** Allows for context variation

#### Request Structure Template

```markdown
[PRIMARY ACTION] [SPECIFIC OBJECT] [CONTEXT/CONSTRAINTS] to achieve [OUTCOME]

**Success Criteria:**
- [Measurable result 1]
- [Quality standard 1]
- [Completeness requirement 1]

**Scope Boundaries:**
- Include: [What must be covered]
- Exclude: [What should not be included]
- Focus: [Primary emphasis]
```

### Practice Exercise 3.1: Request Refinement

**Starting Point:** "Help me with my presentation"

**Your Task:** Transform this vague request into a precise, actionable specification

**Guided Development:**

1. **Identify the specific action:** What exactly needs to be done?
2. **Define the object:** What presentation? What aspects?
3. **Establish context:** Who's the audience? What's the purpose?
4. **Set success criteria:** How will you know it's successful?
5. **Define boundaries:** What should be included/excluded?

### Practice Exercise 3.2: Multi-Outcome Requests

**Challenge:** Create requests that specify multiple related outcomes

**Scenario:** Website Content Audit

Design a request that produces:

- Content quality assessment
- SEO optimization recommendations
- User experience improvements
- Performance metrics analysis

## Lesson 4: Examples That Teach

### Learning Goals

- Create examples that demonstrate transferable patterns
- Design example collections that build understanding progressively
- Balance specificity with broad applicability

### Example Design Principles

#### Show Don't Tell

**Ineffective Example:**

```markdown
"Write clearly and concisely"
```

**Effective Example:**

```markdown
### Before (Unclear):
"We need to do some things to make the system better and more efficient 
for users who are having problems with performance issues."

### After (Clear):
"Reduce page load time from 8 seconds to under 3 seconds by optimizing 
database queries and implementing content caching."

**Why This Works:**
- Specific performance target (3 seconds)
- Clear baseline measurement (8 seconds)
- Concrete solution approach (database + caching)
```

### Practice Exercise 4.1: Example Creation

**Scenario:** Email tone adjustment

Create before/after examples that teach professional email communication:

1. **Difficult conversation** (delivering bad news)
2. **Request for help** (asking for assistance without being demanding)
3. **Project update** (communicating delays professionally)

### Practice Exercise 4.2: Progressive Example Series

**Challenge:** Create a series of examples that build complexity

**Topic:** Data Analysis Requests

Create three examples that show:

1. **Basic:** Simple data summary
2. **Intermediate:** Trend analysis with insights
3. **Advanced:** Predictive analysis with recommendations

Each example should build on the previous while introducing new concepts.

## Lesson 5: Adjustments and Quality Control
