## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### Content Standards

**All contributions should follow our systematic methodology:**

- **CREATE Framework compliance**: Follow Character, Request, Examples, Adjustments, Type, Extras structure
- **Quality Pyramid principles**: Ensure Completeness, Accuracy, Relevance, and Efficiency
- Be practical and tested in real scenarios
- Include clear examples and use cases
- Follow the existing documentation style and systematic approach
- Be cross-model compatible when possible
- Include proper attribution for sources

**üìã Methodology Reference**: Review [methodology/README.md](methodology/README.md) for comprehensive framework guidance.

### File Organization

When adding new content, place it in the appropriate directory:

```text
methodology/        - Core CREATE Framework and Quality Pyramid principles
prompts/           - Ready-to-use prompt patterns organized by use case and role
guides/            - Implementation guidance and quick reference materials
examples/          - Real-world applications and case studies
learning-resources/ - Structured learning pathways and training materials
```

### Documentation Format

- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Include practical examples
- Add "Why this works" explanations
- Provide implementation notes
- Use consistent markdown formatting

### Example Contribution Structure

```markdown
# Technique Name

## Overview
Brief description of what this technique accomplishes.

## When to Use
- Specific scenarios where this is effective
- Context where it provides value

## Implementation
Step-by-step instructions with examples.

## Example
\```
[Actual prompt example]
\```

## Why This Works
Explanation of the underlying principles.

## Variations
Alternative approaches or modifications.
```

## üîÑ Submission Process

### 1. Make Your Changes

- Follow the content standards above
- Test your prompts with multiple LLMs if possible
- Ensure all links and references work correctly

### 2. Validate Locally Before Committing

**üîç Always validate your changes locally before committing:**

```bash
# Run comprehensive validation (recommended)
npm test

# Or run specific validation checks
npm run lint              # Check markdown formatting
npm run lint:fix          # Auto-fix markdown issues
npm run validate          # Full systematic validation
```

**What the validation checks:**

- **Markdown linting**: Ensures consistent formatting and style
- **Repository structure**: Validates required directories and files exist
- **CREATE Framework compliance**: Checks prompt templates follow systematic methodology
- **Quality Pyramid principles**: Ensures educational content meets quality standards
- **Link validation**: Verifies all links work correctly (run manually with npm run link-check)

**üí° Pro tip**: Run `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix most markdown formatting issues before committing.

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: Debugging workflow for API integration issues"
git commit -m "Fix: Broken links in getting started guide"
git commit -m "Docs: Improve clarity in prompt structure section"
```

### Commit Message Format

```text
Type: Brief description

Optional longer description if needed.
```

**Types:**

- `Add:` - New content or features
- `Fix:` - Bug fixes or corrections  
- `Update:` - Improvements to existing content
- `Docs:` - Documentation changes
- `Refactor:` - Restructuring without changing functionality
