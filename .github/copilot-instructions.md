## Repository Mission and Methodology

The **prompt-craft** repository provides systematic methodology for prompt engineering excellence, built on two foundational frameworks:

### The CREATE Framework
**Character • Request • Examples • Adjustments • Type • Extras**

Every prompt engineering task should systematically apply:
- **Character**: Define role, expertise, and perspective
- **Request**: Specify clear, actionable outcomes  
- **Examples**: Provide high-quality demonstrations
- **Adjustments**: Include constraints and guardrails
- **Type**: Specify output format and structure

### The Quality Pyramid
**Completeness → Accuracy → Relevance → Efficiency**

Foundation-up quality assurance ensuring:
- **Completeness**: All necessary context systematically included
- **Accuracy**: Validation against requirements and best practices
- **Relevance**: Perfect match to user's specific needs and use case
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for performance, cost, and maintainability
