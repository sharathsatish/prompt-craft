# Prompt Craft: The CREATE Framework and Quality Pyramid

## A systematic methodology for prompt engineering built on proven frameworks and quality principles

## Transform Your AI Capabilities

This repository provides a comprehensive methodology for systematic prompt engineering, moving beyond ad-hoc
experimentation to engineering discipline that scales from individual use to team collaboration to enterprise
implementation.

**Built on two fundamental frameworks:**

- **The CREATE Framework**: Systematic prompt construction ensuring consistent, high-quality AI responses
- **The Quality Pyramid**: Research-backed principles for building effective prompts from the foundation up

## Who This Methodology Serves

### üë§ **Individual Developers & Creators**

Anyone looking to improve their AI interactions with systematic approaches that produce
consistent, high-quality results across different models and use cases.

### üë• **Teams & Collaborators**

Development teams, product groups, and cross-functional collaborators who need shared
frameworks for maintaining quality and consistency in AI-assisted workflows.

### üè¢ **Organizations & Enterprises**

Companies and institutions seeking systematic approaches to AI integration that maintain
quality while scaling across teams, departments, and organizational units.

## Methodology Overview

### The CREATE Framework

#### Character ‚Ä¢ Request ‚Ä¢ Examples ‚Ä¢ Adjustments ‚Ä¢ Type ‚Ä¢ Extras

A systematic approach to prompt construction that ensures every AI interaction includes:

- **Character**: Role and expertise definition
- **Request**: Clear task and outcome specification  
- **Examples**: High-quality demonstrations
- **Adjustments**: Constraints and guardrails
- **Type**: Output format specification
- **Extras**: Additional context and requirements

### The Quality Pyramid

#### Completeness ‚Üí Accuracy ‚Üí Relevance ‚Üí Efficiency

Foundation-up quality assurance ensuring:

- **Completeness**: All necessary context included
- **Accuracy**: Validation against business requirements
- **Relevance**: Match to specific use cases
- **Efficiency**: Optimization for cost and performance

### Systematic Development Principles

- **Analysis Breakdown**: Complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Incremental Implementation**: Small changes with continuous validation
- **Essential-First Approach**: MVP mindset for AI integration
- **Continuous Testing**: Always test after changes
